# Handwritten-Data-Collector-App
You can modify this according to your need -- but please don't forget to reference.
You can use this to collect handwritten data for any language in the world.
For that, in the Enums.cs file, just modify _class paramaters according to your need.
(It is not Enum per se but as it acts like Enum, So I gave it name Enums.)

Fill up the character name and that characters' description according to your need.

Keep description very short without space, as you can see, I have not made it more than 4 characters long.
Create a folder named Uploads inside the project if you don't see there already.
And then, as you run the project, for each descriptive name, a folder will be created automatically.
Thank you for using it.
